This repo will contain the code to produce and manipulate a text file

We will be using libraries like :-
fstreambase
ifstream
ofstream
fstream

To work with a file we will first open it using a constructor and 'open()'
say the file is sample1.txt

the c++ file is basically main.cpp

Main.cpp----->>>>>
